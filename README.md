# ex4

This is about a server application.
The application has 2 implemantaion of servers: serial and parallel.
It also has a super duper problem solver.
The problems it can solve (for now...) are string reversing and shortest way in matrix finder.
We implemented 4 different algorithms to find the shortest way in a matrix full of number representing costs for going into them.
the server can handele up to 10 clients parallel.

you should first run the server then run the clients

you should provide the server the port you want in the main args.
